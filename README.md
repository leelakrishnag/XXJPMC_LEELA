## Tests

A moderately extensive (although my no means exhaustive) suite of tests is included in `tests/`. 
The autodiscovery feature of `unittest` makes it fairly convenient to run them by executing the following command:
 ````
$ cd LEEJPM/
$ python -m unittest -v
````
The `-v` switch is optional and it stands for its verbose mode.
